# Elementary Branch-Price-and-Cut for the VRPSD under Optimal Restocking

## Description
This repository contains the source code and datasets to allow the replication of the results from the paper:

**Florio, A. M., Gendreau, M., Hartl, R. F., Minner, S., & Vidal, T. (2023). Recent Advances in Vehicle Routing with Stochastic Demands: Bayesian Learning for Correlated Demands and Elementary Branch-Price-and-Cut. European Journal of Operational Research 306(3), 1081-1093.**

The paper is also freely available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02538](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02538)

The code implements a branch-price-and-cut (BP&C) algorithm for the VRPSD under optimal restocking.

## Dependencies
The implementation requires:
* The [CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio), which is free for academic use.
* The [CVRPSEP](https://econ.au.dk/research/researcher-websites/jens-lysgaard/cvrpsep) library for the separation of capacity cuts. The CVRPSEP sources are included in this repo.

## Building and Running
A `Makefile` is provided for reference only. This should be adapted to match the specific host requirements, including `CPLEX` header files and libraries. The CVRPSEP library should be compiled separately.

The code compiles into a single executable `vrpsd`. To facilitate scripting, a numerical code is assigned to each standard VRPSD instance. This mapping is available in the source file `Instance.cpp`. For example, instance `A-n32-k5` (Augerat, 1995) corresponds to the instance number `2001`. To solve this instance, simply run:

```
$ ./vrpsd 0 2001
```

Basic instance information is displayed before the algorithm starts to execute:

```
Instance info:
ID: 2001
N: 31
Q: 100
f: 1.000
round to integer: 0
max vehicles: 5
demand distribution: Poisson
expected demand: 410.000
load coeff.: 4.100
*** BRANCH AND PRICE ***
customer 1 demands in [4,39]
customer 2 demands in [5,42]
customer 3 demands in [0,19]
[...]
```

The app is output intensive, so we recommend redirecting the output to a file for posterior analysis. After a few minutes (even though instance `2001` has only 31 customers, it is a difficult instance as many SRCs need to be separated to close the optimality gap), the algorithm finishes and the optimal solution is printed alongside some statistics:
